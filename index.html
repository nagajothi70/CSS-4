        <h3>Error Makes Clever</h3>
        <p>
            You can automate this process by using GitHub Actions to count lines of code periodically.<br><br>
            You can set up a GitHub Action workflow that runs cloc or other line-counting tools and posts the result to a file or dashboard.<br><br>
            This can help you keep track of the line count across your repositories without manually running scripts.
